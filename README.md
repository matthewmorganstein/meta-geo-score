# Enhanced Geometric Calculator Documentation

## Overview

The Meta Geometric Calculator is an advanced system that combines geometric mathematics, meta-learning, and adaptive attention mechanisms to analyze market behavior and generate predictive scores. This documentation explains how the system works, its components, and how to effectively use it for market analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. Meta-Learning System

The meta-learning system allows the calculator to learn and adapt from experience, similar to how experienced traders adjust their strategies based on market conditions.

Key features:
- Stores examples of past calculations and their outcomes
- Learns patterns from similar market situations
- Adapts parameters automatically based on performance
- Maintains a rolling history of 1000 most recent examples

Market behavior capture:
- Identifies recurring market patterns
- Recognizes regime changes
- Adapts to varying volatility levels
- Learns seasonal patterns

Example usage:
```typescript
// The meta-learning system works automatically
const calculator = new EnhancedGeometricCalculator({
    timeWindow: 20,
    initialLearningRate: 0.01
});

// Each calculation contributes to learning
await calculator.calculateScore(currentSignal, history, conditions, technical);
```

### 2. Adaptive Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism acts like a trader's focus, automatically adjusting what aspects of the market it considers most important at any given time.

Components:
- Multi-resolution attention (1-10 levels of detail)
- Dynamic weight adjustment
- Focus shifting based on market conditions

Market behavior capture:
- Micro-patterns in high-frequency data
- Macro trends in longer timeframes
- Relative importance of different indicators
- Market regime transitions

Configuration:
```typescript
// Attention mechanism is self-adjusting but you can monitor it
const attention = calculator.getAttentionState();
console.log(attention.weights);  // See what the system is focusing on
console.log(attention.resolution);  // Current detail level
```

### 3. Geometric Transformations

The geometric transformation system converts market data into a mathematical space where patterns and relationships become more apparent.

Key transformations:
- Energy distortion (temporal changes)
- Momentum distortion (price movement)
- Pressure distortion (volume and volatility)
- Stress distortion (market structure)

Market behavior capture:
- Price momentum and acceleration
- Volume pressure
- Market stress levels
- Structural imbalances

## How It Improves Accuracy

1. Adaptive Learning
- Continuously updates its understanding of market conditions
- Reduces false signals over time
- Adapts to changing market regimes
- Learns from mistakes through feedback loops

2. Multi-scale Analysis
- Captures both short-term and long-term patterns
- Reduces noise in calculations
- Provides more robust signals
- Balances different timeframes automatically

3. Geometric Intelligence
- Transforms complex market relationships into measurable metrics
- Identifies hidden patterns through geometric analysis
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving important information
- Creates more stable indicators

## Enhanced Interoperability

1. Data Integration
```typescript
interface MarketData {
    price: number[];
    volume: number[];
    volatility: number[];
    // Add custom metrics
    customMetrics?: {[key: string]: number[]};
}

// The calculator can handle additional data sources
calculator.addDataSource(marketData);
```

2. Signal Output
```typescript
interface SignalOutput {
    score: number;
    confidence: number;
    components: {
        energy: number;
        momentum: number;
        pressure: number;
        stress: number;
    };
    metadata: {
        attention: AttentionState;
        metaLearning: MetaLearningState;
    };
}
```

3. System Integration
- Compatible with RISE SDK
- Can be used as a standalone signal generator
- Provides detailed component breakdown
- Exports state for external analysis

## New Insights

1. Component Analysis
- Breakdown of market forces into fundamental components
- Understanding of which factors drive current market behavior
- Identification of regime changes
- Early warning system for market stress

2. Pattern Recognition
- Automatic identification of similar historical patterns
- Recognition of developing market conditions
- Detection of anomalies
- Classification of market states

3. Risk Assessment
- Multi-dimensional risk measurement
- Stress testing through geometric analysis
- Confidence scoring for signals
- Regime change detection

## Practical Applications

1. Trading Signals
```typescript
// Generate trading signals
const signal = await calculator.calculateScore(
    currentMarket,
    historicalData,
    marketConditions,
    technicalIndicators
);

if (signal > 0.7) {
    // Strong bullish signal
} else if (signal < 0.3) {
    // Strong bearish signal
}
```

2. Risk Management
```typescript
// Get risk decomposition
const riskAnalysis = calculator.analyzeRisk(currentMarket);
console.log(riskAnalysis.stressLevel);
console.log(riskAnalysis.pressurePoints);
```

3. Market Analysis
```typescript
// Analyze market state
const marketState = calculator.analyzeMarketState(currentMarket);
console.log(marketState.regime);
console.log(marketState.dominantFactors);
```

## Performance Optimization

1. Memory Management
- Rolling window of historical data
- Efficient example storage
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Optimized data structures

2. Computational Efficiency
- Parallel processing of components
- Cached intermediate calculations
- Efficient matrix operations
